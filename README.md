# DESCRIPTION

A pure object oriented interface to PayPal's NVP API (Name-Value Pair). A lot of the logic in this module was taken from [Business::PayPal::NVP](https://metacpan.org/pod/Business::PayPal::NVP). I re-wrote it because it wasn't working with Catalyst adaptors and I couldn't save instances of it in Moose-type accessors. Otherwise it worked fine. So if you don't need that kind of support you should visit [Business::PayPal::NVP](https://metacpan.org/pod/Business::PayPal::NVP)!.
Another difference with this module compared to Business::PayPal::NVP is that the keys may be passed as lowercase. Also, a response will return a WebService::PayPal::NVP::Response object where the response values are methods. Timestamps will automatically be converted to DateTime objects for your convenience.

# NAME

WebService::PayPal::NVP - PayPal NVP API

# METHODS

## api\_ver

The version of PayPal's NVP API which you would like to use.  Defaults to 51.

## errors

Returns an `ArrayRef` of errors.  The ArrayRef is empty when there are no
errors.

## has\_errors

Returns true if `errors()` is non-empty.

## create\_recurring\_payments\_profile( $HashRef )

## do\_direct\_payment( $HashRef )

## do\_express\_checkout\_payment( $HashRef )

## get\_express\_checkout\_details( $HashRef )

## get\_recurring\_payments\_profile\_details( $HashRef )

## get\_transaction\_details( $HashRef )

## manage\_recurring\_payments\_profile\_status( $HashRef )

## mass\_pay( $HashRef )

## refund\_transaction( $HashRef )

## set\_express\_checkout( $HashRef )

## transaction\_search( $HashRef )

## ua( LWP::UserAgent->new( ... ) )

This method allows you to provide your own UserAgent.  This object must be of
the [LWP::UserAgent](https://metacpan.org/pod/LWP::UserAgent) family, so [WWW::Mechanize](https://metacpan.org/pod/WWW::Mechanize) modules will also work.

## url

The PayPal URL to use for requests.  This can be helpful when mocking requests.
Defaults to PayPals production or sandbox URL as appropriate.

# TESTING

The main test will not work out of the box, because obviously it needs some sandbox/live api details before it can proceed. Simply create an `auth.yml` file in the distribution directory with the following details:

    ---
    user: 'api_user'
    pass: 'api password'
    sig:  'api signature'
    branch: 'sandbox or live'

If it detects the file missing completely it will just skip every test. Otherwise, it will only fail if any of the required information is missing.

# CREDITS

A lot of this module was taken from [Business::PayPal::NVP](https://metacpan.org/pod/Business::PayPal::NVP) by Scott Wiersdorf.
It was only rewritten in order to work properly in [Catalyst::Model::Adaptor](https://metacpan.org/pod/Catalyst::Model::Adaptor).
